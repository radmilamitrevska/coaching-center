## Introduction
For building this task I have used HTML,SASS and Angular5 as JS Framework.
I have started with making structure for project, such as separating different features from the project in different modules, components and services for communication with real API. For styling I have used SASS, it's in separate folder under assets. HTML is written in Angular components.
This project is listing all courses, there is pagination for accessing other courses. User can edit and add courses,also edit and add locations, and add or edit instructors.
